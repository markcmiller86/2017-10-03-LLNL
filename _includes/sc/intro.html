  aims to help researchers improve their productivity
  by teaching them basic and intermediate use of shell, git and python.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools,
  including task automation, version control, data management,
  and secure, remote resource utilization.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
